# MetGENE: susrinivasn@ucsd.edu; mano@sdsc.edu
#  File to set the flag for precomputing
# This flag tells MetGENE to obtain KEGG related data from precomputed tables instead of KEGGREST API
# If set to 0, MetGNE uses keggLink and keggGet calls which slows down the fetch significantly
# In order to use precomputed tables, one must obtain KEGG license.
