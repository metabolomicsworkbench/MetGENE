The above copyright notice and this permission notice (including Section 1 
"Restrictions due to the use of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 
(KEGG) APIs") shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

1. Restrictions due to the use of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) APIs:
While the code provided is not subject to any restrictions, users may require a 
suitable license from KEGG before they use MetGENE depending upon the manner of use.

KEGG APIs are used in this tool. Please see their license terms at 
https://www.kegg.jp/kegg/legal.html (see also https://www.pathway.jp/en/academic.html) 
for restrictions before using it in a particular manner.
The following scripts use KEGG APIs:
extractFilteredStudiesInfo.R
extractMetaboliteInfo.R
extractMWGeneSummary.R
extractReactionInfo.R
data/getCompoundInfoFromKegg.R
data/getKEGGLinkDataForGenes.R
data/getReactionInfoFromKegg.R

1a. Using this code to provide user's own web service:
While it is our understanding that no KEGG license is required to run the web app 
on user's local computer for personal use (e.g., access as 
localhost:install_location_withrespectto_DocumentRoot/MetGENE, or, restrict its 
access to the IP addresses belonging to their own research group), the users must 
understand the KEGG license terms (https://www.kegg.jp/kegg/legal.html, see also 
https://www.pathway.jp/en/academic.html) and decide for themselves. For example, 
if the user wishes to provide this tool (or their own tool based on a subset of 
MetGENE scripts with KEGG APIs) as a service, they must obtain their own KEGG 
license with suitable rights.

1b. Faster version of MetGENE:
If and only if the user has purchased license for KEGG FTP Data, they can activate 
a 'preCompute' mode to run faster version of MetGENE. To achieve this, please set 
preCompute = 1 in the file setPrecompute.R. Otherwise, please ensure that preCompute 
is set to 0 in the file setPrecompute.R. Further, to use the faster version, the user 
needs to run the R scripts in the 'data' folder first. Please see the respective R 
files in the 'data' folder for instructions to run them.
